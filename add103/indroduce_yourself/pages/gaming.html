        I've been playing Valorant since it was released in 2020. I took some breaks due to it consuming so much time. This game is a fps game in 5v5 game mode. I mainly only play competitive, which is skillful match making. A couple weeks ago I finally hit radiant which is the highest rank in this game. Top 500 people in the region, it took hours but this is my game that I usually play in my free time. I have around 10k hours put into this fps game.

        The nostalgia this game brings is crazy, I've been playing wizard101 since I was a kid, it was my first mmorpg and it brought a lot of memories. My cousin told me about this and I was hooked on the game 24/7 in my youth. I recently tried playing this game earlier this year, but the player base is dead. This game has a paywall and the game is basically you pick a wizard between 7 classes and click spells to damage mobs.

        FC26 is a soccer game a new version released every year and it's basically the same concept. You can play with friends, or play online with randoms. Can pick your own team to play with or make your own using the game mode Ultimate Team. This game by far is the most skilled game I played. Players have countless hours on this and you can tell within the first minute if they are good or not. I usually tend to not play this often since I get mad when I'm losing.
