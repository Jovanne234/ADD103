        <p id="car370z-text">My dream car when I was a teenager was a Nissan 370z only because of Fast and Furious Tokyo Drift. I had to work during summer to be able to purchase this car. It was my very first car in high school. The cool part about the car was that it was manual (stick/shift). I had no idea how to drive it, so I had to learn on my own. This car is very tuner friendly and could do so much on engine performance. At this moment I still own this car, I've done so much to the car it can shoot flames, pops and so much more. I also work on this car engine wise due to the reason it breaks often.</p>

        <p id="bmw-text">After growing up, I became a fan of german engineer. So I had to purchase this BMW m240i. The best part of this car is the interior. It looks so modern and up to date with technology. I have only had this car for a year so far so I haven't really done much to it. As well, it's very expensive to do things to it since it's a foreign car. As well I don't know much about the engine of this car so I normally don't work on it if it breaks down. THIS CAR IS FAST!</p>
