    <p>
      NBA 2k26 is a nba video game that consists of multiplayer or my career playing
      with AI's. It allows you to create a player and choose what position to
      play as. It is a team base game and any action can change the way the game
      goes.

    <h2> Power Forward </h2>
    <!--Add a paragraph about whatever your H2 tag was-->
    <p>
      The position that I mainly play is the power forward in short terms "PF".
      This position can be played in many ways, but I specialize in setting
      screens for my team or even shooting. There is <em> competitive game mode </em> that
      is ranked based, which I only play with friends. You can see how different
      people move the basketball and play as a team. Power forwards in 2k26 are
      extremely over powered at the moment because they can carry the team. As
      though, this position is very good not many people can play this build
      correctly. I've been playing this position for many years from the
      previous games.

    <!--Add an H3 tag about a scene or character, include a quote in the paragraph-->
    <h3> Giannis Antetekoumpo </h3>
    <p> Giannis plays for the <strong>Milwaukee Bucks</strong> and is a very known player in the NBA. He plays in the power forward position and has won 1 ring in his time in the Bucks. A nba ring is the highest award that the team can get, it means that they were the champions of the entire league. He normally can shoot the ball and can dunk thats his play style playing the power forward position. </p>
    <q> If I can't score, I do whatever I can to support my teammates. </q> <br>
    <q> When you focus on your past, that's your ego. When you focus on your future, that's your pride. </q> <br>
