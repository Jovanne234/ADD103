      Favorite Winter things
    </h1>

    <h2>Activities</h2>
    <p style="color: darkgreen; font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif">
      A fun activity that I love participating in is sledding. Grab some snow
      gear and some friends and go to our local park that consists of hills. It
      usually ends up as us having a snowball fight or building a snowman and
      using our snow gear on the snowman. Another fun activity during the winter
      is when they put up the Christmas tree and lights in Chicago. The
      Christmas tree is humongous and is filled with joy and smiles from the
      public.

    <h2>Hot Chocolate and Pozole</h2>
    <p>
      A typical winter dish my family usually makes during the holidays is
      pozole. It's a hispanic dish that is a stew based with hominy and meat
      typically pork. You can add many toppings to it as you please but its warm
      and very delicious. You can never go wrong with hot chocolate that is my
      to go drink during the morning or whenever I've been outside in the cold.

    <h3>Christmas</h3>
    <p style="color:darkgreen; font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif">
      A family tradition of mine is that we open our christmas gifts on the 24th
      which is Christmas Eve. It's a struggle to stay awake until midnight, but
      having good bounding time with relatives makes it up. As well going to
      church during the morning of Christmas Day it makes me have a stronger
      connection in my religion and faith in God. Coming home after church to
      have a huge feast with the family, favorite dish that they make is a drink
      called ponche. It's a warm beverage that consists of fresh fruits, guavas,
      apples and sugarcane. Sometimes it has dried fruits like raisins or prunes
      but I usually take them off.
