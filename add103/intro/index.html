                         <p> I took classes at the YMCA during middle school and high school during my free time. Currently I am trying to learn some Latin hip hop and Reggaeton, I love latin music. I record myself each time I play the guitar to see my mistakes and improve for the next session. I normally practice twice a week typically with some friends.</p>

                        <p> A unique thing about me as that I make paintings for birthday gifts. Usually on canvases, it first started when I made a halloween basket for my girlfriend with the hello kitty design. The canvas drawings are usually things that the individuals like. </p>
