   <p> Hello there! My name is Jovanne Ortiz, I am returning student at McHenry County College. I am going for my Associates in Software Application Design and Development. I grew up in Little Village right outside of the suburbs of Chicago and moved out when I was a teenager. My current occupation is a MA at the hospital, yeah I know huge jump into a different career. Here are somethings that I'm passaionate about and what defines me in the list below. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Gaming</li>
        <li>Cars</li>
        <li>Building Computers</li>
    </ul>

    <p>These passions of mine started mainly when I was a teenager. My passion in cars is the biggest one, since I was surrounded by "sports cars" by friends and family. Another unique fact about myself is that I thought myself how to play the guitar. I can only play latin pop songs at the moment. </p>
